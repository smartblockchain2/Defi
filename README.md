# Multi Function Finance Platform

This is an exciting journey into creating an Ethereum Decentralized Finance Platform with the capability to provide a variety of Systems and Services.  Systems will be incentivized to increase customer participation on the platform.


> System and Services

- Initial Stake Offering (ISO). 
    * Staking Pools.  Initially one pool, with the framework in place to grow additional pools as the saturation level of existing pools increase and lower staking reward returns.
    * ISO Token is the native token for this platform.  The native token rewards incentivizes traffic to this site.
      * Native token staking rewards during the ISO planned rollout.  This is a very low priced token that is used as liquidity on this platform.
         - Ethereum 2 Token Staking Rewards.
         - Allow earining Native Token Rewards for the Ethereum Staked.
         - A game allowing to earn native rewards and staking these rewards.
    
- Exchange. The ability to purchase and exchange crypto currencies.
- Decentralized Finance.  
   * Allow users to create their own tokens to facilitate funding their dream.  
     --  Invite others to invest in their Idea / Project / Business /Adventure.
   * Provide loans.  (I'm not clear on this process yet)
- A platform for creating and selling NFT's.

The ideas captured here are ones I've seen on other sites like Ray Token and Yieldly.
